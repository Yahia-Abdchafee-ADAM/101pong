<p>Pong, an arcade game developped in 1972 by Ralph Baer (Atari), is the first ever successful video game. It
was inspired by the very first video game, Tennis for Two, developped in 1958 by William Higinbotham on
an oscilloscope. </p>
<p>The goal of this project is to work on a 3D version of this game (or of the Breakout game. . . ). Only one paddle
will be considered, located in the (Oxy) plane (which is defined by the equation z = 0).</p>
